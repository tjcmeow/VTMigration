Dear Captain
 
Thank you for your e-mail. 
 
Before we can renew your licence for VOD, you must send us a different 'request keyâ€™ file. The file you have sent can only be used for activating your VODbox for the first time.
 
To create the request key file:
 
1. Log into VOD as Administrator,  look for the 'Renew Licence' button on the Administrator's Main Menu, bottom right corner.
2. Insert your VODStick into the front left hand USB socket, click the 'Renew Licence' button.
3. Email the file called 'vodkey.vod' that is copied to the VODStick to support@videotel.com
 
Further details are included with the guidance notes supplied with VOD.

Kind regards
