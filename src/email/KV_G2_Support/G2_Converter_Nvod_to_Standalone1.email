Dear Captain,

The attached files will convert the VOD unit to an NVOD unit

This update needs to be installed directly onto the VOD.

The attached file should be unzipped.

Can you take the nvod_config and nvod_config.sig out of the zipped folder so that they are directly on the USB stick.

Please ensure that you are downloading the attached files to the blue VODStick or a USB that is 1-2GB in size and FAT32 formatted.

Please press CTRL+ALT+F4 before inserting USB stick. You will receive a prompt to proceed.
Process will take about 10 seconds to run. Once the patch has been applied, the system will display:

"The G2 needs to restart. Please remove any VODSticks or DVDs and press any key when ready.‚Äù

After the system reboots, your unit will be an NVOD unit.
