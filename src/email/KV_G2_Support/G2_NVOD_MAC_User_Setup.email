Dear Captain

So that the MAC users onboard can connect to the NVOD server the following instructions need to be followed

The procedure for owners of OSX is as follows :

1.) To begin editing the hosts file, you will need to use a Terminal window. 
Open one either by clicking on Applications, then Utilities and then Terminal, 
or by pressing Cmd-Spacebar to open Spotlight, typing Terminal and pressing 
Return. 

2.) We now need to open the hosts file for editing in the Terminal. We do this 
by entering the following command (or Copy and Paste from below) at the Terminal 
prompt: 
sudo nano /private/etc/hosts 

Press Return(enter). Terminal will ask you to enter your Administrator Password:

Do so and again press Return (enter).

3.) The hosts file will open in the Terminal window for editing:

To navigate the hosts file, use your arrow keys to move up and down. The lines 
beginning with the hash (#) symbol are comments and should not be edited. 

4.) Use the â†“ Arrow Key to move the cursor to a blank space at the bottom of the 
hosts file, and enter your new mapping here 10.0.2.60 nvod. 

5.) To save the hosts file after editing, press Ctrl-o. This will bring up a 
prompt for the file name to write to: 

Press Return (enter) to save the hosts file. You can then exit editing the hosts file by 
pressing Ctrl-x. This will return you to the Terminal prompt:

Once complete please open a browser and type http://nvod
