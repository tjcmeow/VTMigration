Dear Captain

The attached patch that will rectify this issue with code 864 not recording in OTM+

This update needs to be installed directly onto the VOD.

The attached file should be unzipped and the nvodconfig and nvodconfig.sig files should be copied onto a USB (Not the Green or Red USB)

 Please press CTRL+ALT+F4 before inserting USB stick.
Process will take about 10 seconds to run. Once the patch has been applied, the
system will display:

"The G2 needs to restart. Please remove any VOD
Sticks or DVDs and press any key when ready.‚Äù

Kind regards
